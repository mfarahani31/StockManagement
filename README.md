# STOCK MANAGEMENT MICROSERVICE
===============================================

A simple REST Application which manages the product stock in an E-Shop
---

In the app a user works with these functions;

(The Product has a predefined initial stock of 100)

* The whole product information for insertion
* The stock of a product for getting the stock
* Can Refill the product stock
* Buying the product decreases the stock
* Product can be reserved for a specified time and must be released (back to stock) after it, if it hasn't been bought.

! It is not allowed to buy a product more than its stock

---

`Spring-boot`, `Maven` is used as the main tool for developing project. Those help us to focus on business more.

This project follows the `RESTFUL` best practices exposing needed endpoints

---

The business is so simple that code should be kept simple. So it should be avoided to implement strange concepts

Hopefully this project will be continued in order to implement other concepts.
